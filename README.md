# Introduction

Aztec is more than ‘just’ a layer 2 solution for Ethereum. It’s chain agnostics, which means that it is possible to bring Aztec connect (privacy /anonymity) to other chains, both rollups and alt L1´s

This repository consists of multiple chains which all include the specific code(contracts) and data from that specific chain. This data could be anything from tech (e.g. gas fees) to business (demand from this specific chain for Aztec connect).
